# 3D-Graphics-Processing

ABSTRACT

In the Advanced Computer Design course, I completed multiple projects with respect to graphics processing.
These ranged from interfacing GPIO pins with LEDs and switches to doing diffused reflection on an LCD display. Some
of these tasks are making a screensaver with rotating squares and a forest. Another task was to draw a 3D coordinate system
along with a cube and the top half of a sphere. The final project required us to integrate all of these features along with diffused
reflection which was accomplished and will be shown in this report.

I. INTRODUCTION

This project required the use of the LPC1769 microcontroller. The LPC1769 is a Cortex-M3 microcontroller with
512kB of Flash memory and up to 70 General Purpose Registers. This report will briefly introduce all the projects
done in this course and a detailed analysis of the Final project, which is on the 3D Graphics Processing Engine.
The projects done in this course are as follows:
• Generating screen saver of rotating squares
• Generating forest screen saver
• Generating 3d coordinate system
• Generating Cube
• Generating Sphere
• Generating Diffuse reflection on top of the cube
• Generating ray equation and shadow for the cube
• Generating a tree on the frontal surface of the cube using a Linear Algorithm
• Generating S alphabet on the top half of the sphere

II. CONCLUSION

I learned about generating screensavers on an LCD display and the formulae required to generate them. Converting
mathematics to code to execute in C language proved to be very beneficial for me.

The second project with the 3D coordinates, sphere, and cube gave me ample information about 3D to 2D coordinate
conversion and how to generate them using basic mathematics. Being able to place them one on top of the other and generating
them all at the same time with clarity and calculating the math behind them proved to be a tough task for me.

The final project with Diffused reflection, Shadows and Decoration was the toughest of all the tasks and took the
most effort to complete. Calculating the mathematics and the equations for each of the items to be completed gave me
satisfaction when all of them worked in sync. I learned about how diffused reflection and shadows work and in detail about
3D graphics processing and the amount of work that goes into rendering even the most basic of shapes like cubes or trees.
Further improvements are not needed in terms of the projects but more optimization in terms of storage and I/O
improvements are something that needs to be looked into in the future. Other data structures apart from Arrays can be used
to limit space usage and make the images render even faster. Better logic could also be written with fewer lines and can
result in lesser execution times.
